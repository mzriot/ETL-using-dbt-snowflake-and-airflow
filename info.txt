Snowflake code:

use role accountadmin;

create warehouse dbt_wh with warehouse_size='x-small';
create database dbt_db;
create role dbt_role;

show grants on warehouse dbt_wh;
grant usage on warehouse dbt_wh to role dbt_role;
grant role dbt_role to user aman7;
grant all on database dbt_db to role dbt_role;

use role dbt_role;
create schema dbt_db.dbt_schema;

**** 
"if warehouse already exists we can use these commands to get rid of them and then we can rerun the above codes"

use role accountadmin;
drop warehouse if already exists dbt_wh;
drop database if already exists dbt_db;
drop role if already exists dbt_role;

****


Terminal - commands

dbt init
- select snowflake
-- fill all essential details and refer above warehouse, database and role.
 
 open file in vscode and we start editing the yml file.

in the yaml file we will be adding two tables:\

models:
  ELT_PIPELINE:
    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      snowflake_warehouse: dbt_wh
    marts:
      +materialized: table
      snowflake_warehouse: dbt_wh 
      
and then we create two folders with the name staging and marts under the model folders

we will create a yaml file named packages and follow the code:

packages:
 -package: dbt-labs/dbt-utils
  version: 1.3.0
